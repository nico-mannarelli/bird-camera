## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline from data preparation to deployment:

- **Dataset:** NABirds (555 North American bird species)
- **Model:** YOLOv8 
- **Training:** 50 epochs on AWS SageMaker ml.g4dn.xlarge GPU
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud with automatic model downloading
- **Performance:** 97%+ confidence on test images, ~300ms inference time

### Key Features
- ✅ Real-time bird detection with bounding boxes
- ✅ Species classification across 555 bird types
- ✅ Web-based interface for easy testing
- ✅ Drag-and-drop image upload
- ✅ Confidence scores for each detection

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Live Web App
Simply visit [the deployed app](https://bird-camera-cdp4j7hnunww5vie2ty4fa.streamlit.app/) and upload a bird image!

### Option 2: Run Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nico-mannarelli/bird-camera.git
cd bird-camera

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

The model will automatically download from Google Drive on first run (~23MB).

### Option 3: Command Line Inference
```bash
# Detect birds in a single image
python inference.py --image path/to/bird.jpg

# Adjust confidence threshold
python inference.py --image bird.jpg --conf 0.5
```

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Downloaded NABirds dataset
- Converted annotations from original format to YOLO format
- Split into training/validation sets
- Uploaded to S3 bucket for SageMaker access

### 2. Model Training
```python
# Key training parameters
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
results = model.train(
    data='dataset.yaml',
    epochs=50,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=16,
    device=0  # GPU
)
```

- Used transfer learning from pre-trained YOLOv8 weights
- Trained for 50 epochs with early stopping (patience=10)
- Monitored loss, mAP, precision, and recall

### 3. Deployment Pipeline
1. Model trained on SageMaker → saved to S3
2. Downloaded and packaged model weights
3. Created Streamlit web interface
4. Deployed to Streamlit Cloud
5. Model auto-downloads from Google Drive on first run

# Function configuration
# Note: Free tier has 10s timeout, Pro tier has 26s timeout
# ML model loading may exceed these limits on first request

  # Python functions are automatically detected
  # Timeout is set per function or globally

# Note: Netlify Functions limitations:
# - Free tier: 10 second timeout (may timeout on first request)
# - Pro tier: 26 second timeout (better but still tight)
# - Payload limit: 6MB
# - Cold starts can be slow
# 
# Recommendation: Consider Railway/Render backend if timeouts occur
